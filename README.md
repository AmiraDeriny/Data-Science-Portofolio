#[Project 1: Analyze_ab_test_results](https://github.com/AmiraDeriny/Data-Science-Portofolio/blob/main/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb)
**ML with Logistic Regression:** Using Logistic Regression to predict one of two possible outcomes.<br/>A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
In this project, the main goal is to analyze the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:<br/>Implement the new webpage.<br/>Keep the old webpage.<br/> or Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
